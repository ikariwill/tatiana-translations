              A good translation is the one, that reads naturally. Through a
              special selection of words and expressions, I will provide your
              audience a comfortable reading experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              For this, it is essential that I know my audience in depth. Thanks
              to my many yearsâ€™ experience as a translator, I can understand
              different target groups and adapt the texts to the respective
              audience.

              During my studies I got to know two especially important
              perspectives: on the one hand, that of the highly specialized
              professionals such as doctors and researchers, and on the other
              hand, that of people without medical expertise such as adult and
              pediatric patients.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want an efficient and uncomplicated communication with your
              target group, please contact me. Through my extensive experience,
              I will make sure that your audience understands your document and
              identifies with it.
