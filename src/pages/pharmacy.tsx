                In the pharmaceutical industry, I built four years&apos;
                experience in several areas: customer service and medical
                information, pharmacovigilance and quality assurance.
              </li>

                Partnerships with agencies for supplying translations to the
                pharmaceutical industry. It is this multiplicity of academic and
                professional experiences that I apply in my work as a
                translator.

            <p>
              Hiring a pharmacist to translate pharmaceutical documents means
              you will have absolute certainty that your material will be as
              accurate and appropriate as possible for your target audience. In
              addition, I will help you to spare your costs and time, since the
              questions and revisions of your document will be reduced from
              minimum to zero.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you want a pharmaceutical translation by an expert with over a
              decade&apos;s experience, get a quote with me. Ensure the quality
              of your translation with the certainty that the Brazilian audience
              will connect with your document.
